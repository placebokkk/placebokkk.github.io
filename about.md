I am a father/sport-lover/programmer living in Suzhou,China.

I used to work in Microsoft, AISpeech and a start-up. Now I work as an engineer in Mobvoi, focusing on machine learning and ASR technique. 
I also teach children basketball and coach an adult basketball team in spare time.



**2020 blogging plan**

List my 2020 blogging plan and will review it in the end of 2020. 
This helps me track my focus of every year.

1. Notes about Kaldi. Kaldi is a great open-source ASR toolï¼Œ which contains every aspects of traditional ASR and shows consistent code style and detailed comments. Thanks to Dan and kaldi contributors for giving such a gift to the world.
I mainly plan to learn 3 parts of Kaldi.  
    * Nnet3. Learn how a nerual netword engine is designed.
    * Decoder. Now I know the basic Decoder in Kaldi. Hope to understand more.
    * Ivector. This feature is magical.It helps great in some SID and ASR tasks, I want to understand this model better.
1. Streaming E2E ASR, CTC/RNN-t/Attetion. E2E has domainated the SOTA for all AI applications except ASR. Although it has given SOTA results on special domains or scenarios, it is hard to debug and incorparate separate LMs. Google even used RNN-t in its device ASR production. 
1. If having more time, I hope to learn the stuffs of deep-learning system design, such as pytorch/TVM.
